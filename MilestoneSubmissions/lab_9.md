4. Application Name: Study_Room
5. Application Description
   This is a platform designed for students to interact with eachother on a real time basis. Students can use this platform to discuss what is happening during class, ask clarifying questions, and meet other people in the class all without disrupting the flow of lecture.

   This application is designed to only let students who are actively enrolled in the course to be apart of some of these chat groups. That way, future students who take the same class, don't have access to much of the class material, that could prevent them from learning it the right way. This application will be build upon a Websocket and Node.JS framework, such that information can be updated and displayed without the user needing to refresh the page. Chat history (including group chats and direct messages), as well as user profile data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

6. Vision Statement:

   For students who want real time communication about class topics, this platform differenciates itself from Discord, Piazza and Slack by adding another layer of sercurity. Only students who are actively enrolled in a class can view or discuss class material. This platform also serves as a way to easily connect new people together through a common topic: their classes.
